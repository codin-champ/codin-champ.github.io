I'm an India based developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

Currently I'm a first-year Under-Graduate student at International Institute of Information Technology pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

Outside college, I occasionally work on Advanced Data Structures and exploring new things like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
