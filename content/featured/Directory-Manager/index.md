<!-- Collaborated with the [Developer Team](https://caimconsulting.in/developers/?) to develop the front-end and deploy the website on Heroku for a pro-bono legal startup [Caim Consulting](https://caimconsulting.in/). -->

Developed a File Managing system 'Directory-Manager' that imitates the traditional bash shell, which allows you to manage your files and folders with the basic commands. 

This project was designed as mini-project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course under Dr. Ravi Kiran and Dr. Sujit Gujar.
